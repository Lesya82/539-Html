	<br>
	<h2><b><i><a href="https://petadvisor.in.ua/blog/pro-sobak/nimetska-vivcharka/">The German Shepherd</a></i></b> is a
		dog breed bred in Germany in 1899.</h2>
	<p>The German Shepherd Dog is one of America’s most popular dog breeds — for good reasons.
		They’re intelligent and capable working dogs. Their devotion and courage are unmatched. And they’re amazingly
		versatile.
		The breed also goes by the name Alsatian. Despite their purebred status, you may find German Shepherds in
		shelters and breed specific rescues. So remember to adopt! Don’t shop if this is the breed for you.</p>

	<p>German Shepherds have a double coat which is close and dense with a thick undercoat. The coat is accepted in two
		variants: medium and long. The long-hair gene is recessive, making the long-hair variety rarer. Treatment of the
		long-hair variation differs across standards; they are accepted but not competed with standard coated dogs under
		the German and UK Kennel Clubs while they can compete with standard coated dogs, but are considered a fault in
		the <a href="https://www.akc.org/">American Kennel Club.</a>In terms of coat color, there are the following
		different types of German Shepherd:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Saddle coat German Shepherd Dog,</li>
		<li>Black German Shepherd Dog,</li>
		<li>Sable German Shepherd Dog,</li>
		<li>Panda German Shepherd Dog,</li>
		<li>White German Shepherd Dog.</li>
